#### Hi, I'm Kishan Yerneni

I am an aspiring software engineer who is passionate about all kinds of technology. I am eager to learn new things, which is why I tend to start projects with unfamiliar frameworks and applications in order to get better using them. I am currently a second year student at the University of Houston, where I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. Please feel free to check out some of my projects in my Repository tab.
